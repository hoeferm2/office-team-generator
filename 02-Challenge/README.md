## This weeks task

The task for this weeks challenge was to make a office team badge generator that run the user through a series of prompts to create individual employee badges.

Users start the process by clicking on the command-line application which runs through a series of input questions. Initially all users start at the list menu which contains 4 options (Manager Sign in, Add Enginner, Add Intern, Close Application). The user may choose to create any number of employees. Each time an employee is logged the user returns to the start screen until the close the application Employees are sorted by role and each employee badge contains name, id, and email. For Managers they have a unique trait called office number, engineers gitHub account, and interns school.

## Generate HTML
Once the user had made thier employees they must choose the close applicaiton option. When they do an html is generated with the requisite badges displayed.
